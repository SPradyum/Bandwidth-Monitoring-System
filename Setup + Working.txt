This Project is made in Python Programming Language

Setup:
Things you require to run this code are:
1. Python Supporter IDE (recommended - Visual Studio Code)
2. Python installed on your computer
3. Installing 'psutil' library (run this command in the IDE Terminal : pip install psutil)

Working:
1.Importing Libraries: This script begins by importing two Python libraries: ‘time’ and ‘psutil’.
	-> ‘time’ is used for controlling time-related functions.
	-> ‘psutil’ Is a library for gathering system information, including network data.

2. Initial Network Data: It initializes variables (‘last_received’, ‘last_sent’) to store the total amount of data received and sent over the network at the start of the script.

3. Infinite Loop: The code enters an infinite loop (‘while True’) to continuously monitor network traffic.

4. Curent Network Data: Inside the loop, it retrieves the current amount of data received and sent over the network and calculated the total data transferred (‘bytes_received’,’bytes_sent’,’bytes_total’).

5. New Data Calculation: It calculates the new data received and sent since the last measurement by subtracting the previous values from the current values (‘new_received’,’new_sent’,’new_total’).

6. Data Conversion: The script converts the new data from bytes to megabytes (‘mb_new_received’,’mb_new_sent’,’mb_new_total’) for easier readability.

7. Display: it prints the new data received, sent, and the total data transferred in megabytes with two decimal places.

8. Updating Previous Values: The previous data values (‘last_received’,’last_sent’,’last_total’) are updated with the current values, so they can be used as references in the next iteration.

9. Sleep: The Script pauses for 1 second (‘time.sleep(1)’) before repeating the process, effectively monitoring network traffic every second.
